## Overview

SharedFast is built using Kotlin and Gradle, making it easy to set up and customize. This project is focused on note sharing—allowing users to quickly save and disseminate notes. It aims to provide a simple, modular foundation that can be extended or integrated into larger applications if needed.

## Features

- **Easy Note Sharing:** Create, organize, and share notes quickly.
- **Modular Design:** Easily extend or integrate the note-sharing features into your own applications.
- **Kotlin-Powered:** Utilizes modern Kotlin features for a clean and efficient codebase.
- **Gradle Build System:** Simplifies project setup and dependency management.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or later**
- **Gradle** (or use the provided Gradle Wrapper)

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abdullah134/SharedFast.git
cd SharedFast
```

Build the project using the Gradle wrapper:

```bash
